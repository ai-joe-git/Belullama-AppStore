# CasaOS LocalAI AppStore

A CasaOS custom Appstore containing some usefull images.
The **LocalAI AppStore** is a custom appstore built to work for [CasaOS](https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS).
This custom appstore for CasaOS contains some additional configurations of docker images which are not available in the official appstore and I think they are useful.
